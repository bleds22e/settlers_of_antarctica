## Assignment Details

### Purpose

The goal of this assignment is to find, summarize, and cite research articles related to your research question and practice writing an abstract.

### Task

Use generative AI to find relevant articles, assess their relevance to your research question, and integrate scientific literature into your writing about your research question.

### Criteria for Success

-   Find 10 scientific articles using the given prompts.
-   Include the results of your search in the document.
-   Determine which 3 articles are most related to your research question and provide a summary of those articles.
-   Write an abstract to a scientific article focused on your research question using the resources selected and information about your dataset.

### Due Date

Dec 5 at 11 am MST

## Assignment Instructions

This assignment will guide you through the process of finding, citing, and summarizing scientific articles related to your research question. You will ultimately use these research articles to write an abstract for a scientific paper. You will use **ScholarGPT** to identify relevant sources and practice synthesizing scientific information. Additionally, you'll use an online tool to correctly format citations in APA style.

By the way, I used **ChatGPT** to help me create this assignment! It took a lot of iteration and very specific prompts, and I still needed to make numerous edits. Generative AI is awesome as a partner, but you need to make sure you are using it critically, not as the only tool.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Part 1: Find 10 Relevant Articles (5 Points)

### What is ScholarGPT, and Why Are We Using It?

ScholarGPT is a tool that utilizes OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT and specializes in helping users find academic articles. Unlike ChatGPT, ScholarGPT focuses on academic research and avoids fabricating citations, which ChatGPT is prone to do. Fabricated citations are misleading, unethical, and unacceptable in academic work.

### How to Access ScholarGPT:

Open [ScholarGPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-3DGi2iLag-scholargpt). If you have an account with ChatGPT, you're welcome to sign in, but you should be able to complete the assignment without an account.

### How to Write a Good Prompt

In the text box, prompt **ScholarGPT** to provide **10 academic articles** related to your research question. The better your prompt is, the better the results will be!

-   Include a clear and concise version of your research question in the prompt. That said, though, most research papers will be written about your general topic but rarely about your exact dataset or exact question. Think about the general trend that your research question is asking.
-   Also include clear instructions for the outputs that ScholarGPT should provide. In this case, make sure that each article has a summary that is 3-5 sentences.
-   You might have to ask again to get what you want. I gave ScholarGPT the following prompt: *"Provide 10 peer-reviewed academic articles related to the effects of urbanization on bird migration patterns. Return a 3-5 sentence summary of each article."*, but each summary was 1-2 sentences! I followed up with *"Each summary should be a minimum of 3 sentences"*, and the results were much more informative!

You might need to write a few different versions of your prompt until you get results from ScholarGPT that make sense. This iterative process is a really important part of using generative AI responsibly!

### Including Your Results

Once you have some results that look good, I want you to copy and paste them into this .Rmd file.

1.  First, tell me what prompt you eventually used to get your answers. If you had to offer follow-up instructions (like I did above), include that as well. (1 point)

*Prompt*:

2.  Copy the list of articles and their summaries into your document. Fun fact, anything you copy from ChatGPT or related (e.g., ScholarGPT) uses Markdown structure, the same as this RMarkdown file! (4 points)

    I *HIGHLY* recommend switching over into "Source" mode instead of "Visual" mode when you paste your results. This way, the Markdown language will be understood correctly and look much better when you knit your document.

*Results*:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Part 2: Choose 3 Articles for Further Analysis (8 Points)

From the 10 articles, select the **3 most relevant** to your research question.

Now, we are going to ask ScholarGPT to provide us with 2 additional pieces of information about these articles: the abstract of the article and a citation for the article using a common citation format.

-   An abstract in a published article is a concise summary of the main points of the research. It typically includes an object, the methodology of the study, the results of the study, and what conclusions we can draw from the results.
-   We will be asking for citations in APA format, a common citation format. As you'll see in the prompt below, we have specifically requested ScholarGPT to include a Digital Object Identifier (DOI). This is a permanent location on the internet where this article can be found for hundred of years, at least.

Use the following prompt to get more information and citations for each of the three articles you identified. You will want to replace the numbers to match your 3 articles of interest:

*"Provide the abstracts and APA citations for articles #, #, and #. Make sure you include DOIs for each article."*

3.  Copy the results here. Remember to switch over into "Source" mode before pasting your results! (3 points)

*Results*:

4.  Now that you've gotten your results, click on the link that ScholarGPT has provided (either the DOI or the link in the list of 10 articles). For most of your articles, even if you aren't logged into UA WiFi, you should still be able to see the abstract of the article.

    Does the abstract of the article match the abstract that ScholarGPT provided? Does it contain more or less information? Do you see any issues with what ScholarGPT has provided? Write 3-5 sentences discussing this. (2 points)

*Answer:*

5.  For each article, write 1-2 sentences explaining why it is relevant or valuable to your research question. (3 points)

*First Article*:

*Second Article*:

*Third Article*:

## Part 3: Write an Abstract Using Selected Articles (5 Points)

Using at least 2 of the 3 articles you selected in Part 2, write an abstract for your research question. While you may not yet have the complete results for your research question, you can outline the data you are using, your research question, and your predicted results or actual results.

For full credit, the abstract should:

-   Include an opening sentence about the general topic of interest.
-   Include **1-2 sentences about the data** (e.g., its source, type, or relevance).
-   Clearly state your **research question** in **1 sentence.**
-   Use **at least 2 sentences** to reference the selected articles, supporting your research question, predicted results, or actual results. You should use in-text citations to reference your articles. See examples of in-text citations in the example abstract below.
-   Your abstract should be a minimum of 4 sentences.

#### Example Abstract:

Urbanization has been shown by many scholars to correlate with reduced bird populations (Johnson et al. 2021). Smith and Doe (2020) specifically demonstrated that urban sprawl leads to habitat fragmentation, which disrupts migratory routes. This study utilizes data from the National Bird Migration Database, focusing on population trends across urbanized regions. The research question examines how urbanization affects the migratory behaviors of birds. Based on these findings, I predict a decline in migratory bird populations in highly urbanized areas.

6.  Write your abstract here. It can follow a similar structure of the one above or be a little different, but it should follow the guidelines above for full credit. (5 points)

## Part 4: Reflection (2 points)

In this assignment, you've used generative AI to help you find scientific literature related to your research topic, summarize and cite those research papers, and write an abstract.

In some ways, generative AI probably did a great job; in other ways, it probably did not perform its task as directed. I know that I had to spend another 2 hours to finalize the creation of this assignment, even after generative AI produced a nice outline for me!

7.  Based on your experiences in this assignment, what are your takeaways about using generative AI to help conduct research or generally answer questions? Where does it excel? What are potential pitfalls? Your response should be at least 4 sentences. (2 points)
