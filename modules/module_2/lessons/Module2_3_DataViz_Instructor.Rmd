# A Visualization Primer

## Why Does Data Visualization Matter?

### Small Groups

As a group, take 5 minutes to compare your notes and come to a group consensus on your top 3 reasons. Be sure to choose someone to report out!

## Types of Visualization

### Visual cues for communicating data

[Here](http://paldhous.github.io/ucb/2016/dataviz/week2.html) is a decent overview of some of the core concepts of data visualization.

This website is pretty great and goes into a lot of detail about good practices in data visualization. If this is something that really piques your interest, I encourage you to check it out!

In this course, our main take-away from this website is the use of visual cues to communicate data and which ones are better than others.

### Small group activity

In groups, discuss as many all types of visualization that come to mind. It's okay if you don't know what they are called! Make a quick list or draw them out if you prefer.

Types of data visualizations:

[This website](https://www.data-to-viz.com/) is an amazing reference for data visualization methods and when to use what. It also has examples of each type plotted in `ggplot2`.

We will talk more about how to choose the right visualization for your data now and also in the rest of the module.

### Data matching activity

Still in your groups, open the PDF called "data_viz_matching"

Spend a few minutes seeing if you can match the data descriptions to the types of data visualizations.

Each “dataset” is pulled from the same overall dataset: measurements from 344 individual penguins from different species and on different islands over 3 years. Some datasets created multiple plots.

A.	Penguin body mass and flipper lengths
B.	Penguin flipper lengths 
C.	Penguin species and flipper lengths 
D.	Penguins body mass, species, and flipper lengths

## Figure Critique

First, read through [this blog post](https://humansofdata.atlan.com/2019/02/dos-donts-data-visualization/) on the "Dos and Don'ts of Data Visualization"

Now that you have some insights, let's critique these figures below. Yes, these are actual figures in the wild...

-   what aspects don't work
-   what aspects do work
-   how how you present the data?
