# Assignment Details

### Purpose

The goal of this assignment is to practice choosing the correct types of variables for certain plots and to practice writing code for those plots.

### Task

Write R code which produces the correct plot style.

### Criteria for Success

-   Code is within the provided code chunks
-   Code chunks run without errors
-   Code produces the correct result
    -   Code that produces the correct answer will receive full credit
    -   Code attempts with logical direction will receive partial credit
-   Written answers address the questions in sufficient detail

### Due Date

# Assignment Questions

For this assignment, we are going to be making even *more* plots using `ggplot2`! This time, you will be using the dataset you have chosen to work with for your final project.

### Set-Up

1.  Load the `tidyverse` package into the work space. (1 point)

    ```{r}

    ```

2.  Load your chosen dataset (.csv file) into R using the `read_csv()` function. (1 point)

    *Note: the name of your .csv file might have changed.*

    -   krill data from KrillBase -\> `krill.csv`
    -   fur seal pups on Maiviken Island -\> `fur_seals.csv`
    -   Gentoo penguins from Bird Island -\> `gentoos_and_temps.csv`
    -   Chinstrap penguins from Signy Island -\> `chinstraps_on_signy.csv`

```{r}

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Take a look at your dataset. Based on some feedback from Module 1 Assignment 3, we've made a few modifications to each of the dataset to make them a bit more manageable to work with. Please make note of the following changes and/or quirks for your particular dataset.

#### Krill

-   You will want to use the `Krill_per_1m2_log` column as your dependent variable. This is a log-transformed version of the `Krill_per_1m2` column. You don't need to worry about *why* we transformed the data, but this column should be a bit easier to work with.
-   The `Date`, `Year`, and `Month` columns should all be treated as *numeric/continuous* variables.
-   While the `Station` column can *technically* be considered a categorical variable, please use the `Day_Night` column as your qualitative/categorical variable for this assignment and for your research question.

#### Fur Seals

-   If you choose to use the `Date` or `Year` column, treat them as *numeric/continuous* variables.
-   On the other hand, if you use the `Month` column, treat it as a *categorical* variable.

#### Gentoo Penguins

-   The `Year` column has been fixed (there were some issues with years in the 2000s). If you are using the `Year` column, treat it as a *numeric/continuous* variable.
-   The `Colony` column has been modified to consolidate "Upper Natural Arch" and "Lower Natural Arch" into one colony: "Natural Arch." The same thing occurred with "Mountain Cwn."
-   The dataset has a column for the previous year's December temperature. Because counts of chicks took place in January or February (and nests were counted in October/November), the number of chicks is most likely to be related to the temperatures directly after chicks hatched (December of the previous year).

#### Chinstrap Penguins

-   No major changes.
-   I do not recommend using the `MONTH` or `DAY` column.
-   If you use the `YEAR` column, treat it as a *numeric/continuous* variable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Important Instructions and Info!

(a) For *all* of the plots below, be sure to add:

    -   improved labels for the x-axis, y-axis, and the legend (if present)
    -   one of the following themes to your code: `theme_bw`, `theme_classic`, or `theme_light`.

(b) For each question, ***you get to choose the variables you use for each plot!*** Pay attention to which variables are quantitative/continuous vs. qualitative/categorical and where they should go in the code to produce the correct type of plot.

(c) Because I'm having you choose your own variables, the is no Answer Key for this assignment.

(d) Each plot is worth 3 points. Your interpretation is worth 1 point. Some of your plots may be hard to interpret. That's ok! In that case, explain why the plot is challenging to interpret.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.  Produce a histogram plot (just one, not multiple on the same plot). Write 1-2 sentences describing what information you can gather from plot.

```{r warning=FALSE}

```

*Answer:*

4.  Create a multiple histogram plot. Make sure we can see each histogram plot (make sure one isn't blocking another by modifying the transparency and position). Write 1-2 sentences describing what information you can gather from plot.

```{r warning=FALSE}

```

*Answer:*

5.  Create a box-and-whisker plot. Changing the color of the boxes is optional. Make sure to add points to the plot. Write 1-2 sentences describing what information you can gather from plot.

```{r warning=FALSE}

```

*Answer:*

6.  Create a scatter plot. Write 1-2 sentences describing what information you can gather from plot.

```{r warning=FALSE}

```

*Answer:*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.  Restate your research question (it's ok if it is different from the one you wrote down in M1 Assignment 3 given the new columns in your dataset).

*Research question:*

Do any of the plots you made above match up with your research question? (2 pts)

-   If so, identify which plot and explain how you know it matches up correctly (based on qualitative vs. quantitative variables).
-   If not, explain which plot type *would* match your research question and how you know (based on qualitative vs, quantitative variables).

*Answer*:

## Literature Search

When we ask a research question, we always want to find out what other people have already found out about that question to give us an idea of what outcome we might expect.

To do that, we are going to look for some scientific articles about our research question.

Use either the UA Libraries search tool or Google Scholar. You can find more information about how to use both of those [here](https://lib.arizona.edu/find/articles). To find related papers, you will want to search for journal articles that have both your dependent variable and your independent variable included. (e.g., plant height, water).

To determine whether the article is related to your research question, read the title and the abstract.

8.  Choose 2 papers that you think are related to the research question you just wrote. They don't have to be *exactly* related but should be relevant. (4 points)

    Write the citation for each paper below, doing your best to follow the structure below. Fill in as much info as you can (you won't always have all of it).

    In your own words, write a 1-2 sentence summary of what the article is about, based on the title and the abstract.
