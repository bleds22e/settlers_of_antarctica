```{r setup, include=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```



```{r}
sick_fish <- read_csv("../data/fish_sick_data.csv")
```

1.  

    ```{r}
    head(sick_fish)
    ```


### Plotting with base R

4. 

    ```{r}
    hist(sick_fish$num_fish)
    ```


6. 

    ```{r}
    plot(sick_fish$num_fish, sick_fish$num_sick)
    ```


### Using `ggplot2`



8.  

    ```{r}
    ggplot(sick_fish, aes(num_fish, num_sick)) +
      geom_point()
    ```

9. 

    ```{r}
    ggplot(sick_fish, aes(num_fish, num_sick)) +
      geom_point() + 
      labs(x = "Total Number of Fish per Tank",
           y = "Number of Sick Fish per Tank") +
      theme_bw()
    ```


10. 

    ```{r}
    sick_fish %>% 
      group_by(species) %>% 
      summarise(mean_sick = mean(num_sick),
                sd_sick = sd(num_sick))
    ```
