# Introduction to Coding

## Learning Outcomes

-   Students will be able to define the following terms:
    -   object
    -   assignment
    -   vector
    -   function
    -   data frame
-   Students will be able to run code line-by-line and as code chunks from an Rmarkdown file.
-   Students will be able to comment their code effectively.
-   Students will be able to write code assign values to variables and use these variables to perform various operations.
-   Students will be able to use help files to learn how to use functions.
-   Students will be able to recall and explain how functions operate, and the basic syntax around functions (arguments, auto-completion, parentheses).
-   Students will be able to differentiate different data classes in R.
-   Students will learn how to create their own data structures (vectors, data frames).

## Assigning Objects

Assignments are really key to almost everything we do in R. This is how we create permanence in R (e.g. make things that you can reuse throughout your code). Anything can be saved to an object, and we do this with the assignment operator, `<-`. Think of it as having an empty box and putting something in it!

The short-cut for `<-` is `Alt + -` (or `Option + -` on a Mac).

```{r}
# So what does an assignment look like?

mass <- 47.5                # (this is the mass in kg)

age <- 122

mass <- mass * 2            # multiply mass by 2

age <- age - 20             # subtract age by 20

mass_index <- mass/age      # divide mass by age

mass_sq <- mass^2           # raise mass to an exponent

# However, these assignments are simple and you'll rarely do it in real-world scenarios. 

```

## 1-Dimensional Data: Vectors

We can also assign more complex group of elements of the same type to a particular object. This is called a **vector**, a basic data structure in R.

```{r}
mass_kg <- c(3, 2, 4, 9, 7, 3, 6)
mass_kg

animals <- c("cat", "rat", "bat")
animals

# R does everything in vectors
```

## Data Classes

There are a few main data types in R, and they behave differently.

-   numeric (numbers)
    -   integer (no decimals allowed)
    -   double (decimals allowed --- interchangeable with numeric)
-   character (letters or mixture)
-   logical (True or False; T or F)
-   factors (best used for data that need to be in a specific order; levels indicate the order)

```{r}
# Examples of different data classes

mass_kg         # numeric, integer, double

animals         # character

animal_size <- as.factor(c("small", "medium", "large"))

animal_size      # factor, put in order 

logic <- c(T, F, F, T)  # logical

logic

```

Vectors have to contain elements that are all of the same class.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
vec <- c(1, 1.000, "1")

```

## Sub-setting Vectors

Sometimes we want to pull out and work with specific values from a vector. This is called sub-setting (taking a smaller set of the original).

```{r}
# Use square brackets to pull something out of the vector

mass_kg[2]        # Pull out second element in vector

mass_kg[2:4]      # Pull out second, third, and fourth elements from the vector

```

## Functions

**Functions** are pre-written bits of codes that perform specific tasks for us.

Functions are always followed by parentheses. Anything you type into the parentheses are called **arguments**.

```{r}
## Functions
mass_kg_mean <- mean(mass_kg)       # The mean() function takes the average of the mass_kg vector (from above)
mass_kg_mean

round(mass_kg_mean)                 # The round() function will round our mean value

round(mass_kg_mean, digits = 2)     # We can tell round() to round to 2 digits past zero

```

To get more information about a function, use the `help()` function or `? name_of_function`.

```{r}
help(round)                         # Or type "? help"

```

We can use a function called `class()` to figure out the data type of a vector.

```{r}
class(mass_kg)

```

## Group Challenge

Let's practice! Write a few lines of code that do the following:

-   create a vector with numbers from 6 to 1 (6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
-   assign the vector to an object named `vec`
-   subset `vec` to include the last 3 numbers (should include 3, 2, 1)
-   find the sum of the numbers (hint: use the `sum()` function)

Answer: 6

```{r}
vec <- c(6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
vec

vec <- vec[4:6]
vec

sum(vec)

```

Already finished? See if you can condense your code down any further (which may require finding a function we haven't talked about yet) or turn around and help out a neighbor.

```{r}
vec <- seq(6, 1)
sum(vec[4:6])

```

## 2-Dimensional Data: Data Frames

Most of the data you will encounter is two-dimensional, i.e., it has columns and rows. Its structure resembles a spreadsheet (like Excel). R is really good with these types of data.

-   **rows** go side-to-side
-   **columns** go up-and-down

![](row_column.png)

Data frames are made up of multiple vectors. Each vector becomes a column.

```{r}
# Create a simple data frame
plants <- data.frame(height = c(55, 17, 42, 47, 68, 39),
                     nitrogen = c("Y", "N", "N", "Y", "Y", "N"))

# View data frame
plants

```

## Sub-setting Data Frames

Because data frames are two-dimensional, we can subset data in different ways. We can select specific columns, specific rows, or filter rows by values.

**R always takes information for the row first, then the column.**

```{r}
# Sub-setting data frames

# 2-dimensional, so you need to specify row and then column

# Attempting to do plants[3] will lead to code that doesn't work

# Specify a row (4) and a column (1)
plants[4,1]        

# Or just specify a column (2), but note that we still need the comma in "[ , ]"
plants[,2]         

```

Another way to pull out a single column from a data frame is with the `$` operator. This can really come in handy when you know the name of the column but not the position.

```{r}
# Example of pulling columns using a "$"
plants$height

```

## Discussion Point

This is a simple data set, but let's come up with some questions.

Example: Height of plants treated with nitrogen vs. those not treated.

```{r}
# Example: height of plants treated with nitrogen vs. those not treated. 

# Filter rows based on values in the nitrogen column, here we filter those treated with nitrogen
plants[plants$nitrogen == "Y", ]

# Mean height of plants that are treated with nitrogen
mean(plants[plants$nitrogen == "Y", 1])

```

## Group Challenge (5 min)

Using help files on functions ~ 

As a group, find the standard deviation (`sd()`) of the height of plants treated with nitrogen and those not treated with nitrogen. 

Which group has the larger standard deviation?

```{r}
# Standard deviation of plants treated with nitrogen
sd(plants[plants$nitrogen == "Y", 1])

# Standard deviation of plants treated with nitrogen
sd(plants[plants$nitrogen == "N", 1])

```

Come up with a definition of standard deviation (Google is your friend!).

Use the help file to find out how the `sd()` function works, and be prepared to show the code you used.

## Helpful Functions

Below are some functions that I often find very helpful when working with vectors and data frames:

-   `str()`
-   `head()` and `tail()`
-   `length()`
-   `ncol()` and `nrow()`
-   `names()`

```{r}
# Structure of the object
str(plants) 

 # View first 6 values or rows
head(plants)

# First n values or rows
head(plants, n = 4) 

# Last n values or rows
tail(plants, n = 4) 

# For a dataframe, this gives the number of columns
length(plants) 

# For a column in a data frame, this gives the number of rows
length(plants$height) 

# Number of columns
ncol(plants) 

# Number of rows
nrow(plants)  

# List of names in a column or object
names(plants) 
```
